Assignment 1: The method of using terminal and bit bucket

I first created a repo on bitbucket.
I then logged onto UWL ubuntu server.
Next i created a new directory for myself and linked it to bb
I then created a first file using nano and uploaded it to bitbucket by
adding commiting and pushing
I edited the first file around 3 times.
Continuing, I created a new random file to edit, and repeated my processes.
