Assignment 1: The method of using terminal and bit bucket

I first created a repo on bitbucket.
I then logged onto UWL ubuntu server.
Next i created a new directory for myself and linked it to bb
I then created a first file using nano and uploaded it to bitbucket by
adding commiting and pushing
I edited the first file around 3 times.
Continuing, I created a new random file to edit, and repeated my processes.

Important commands
mkdir. creates a directory or folder
cd. changes the directory
ls. shows a list

The following is the order in which to upload the file to bb
nano. to create a file
git add (with filename). readys the file
git commit -m "with a description.". acknowledges the changes
git push origin master. this will upload the added file(s) to bb.
